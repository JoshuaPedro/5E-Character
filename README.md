# 5E Character Sheet Manager (CSM)

##### CSM is a fully integrated character sheet manager for players of 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons.

### Features:
Players are able to create characters with all the necessary information to start playing in a matter of minutes.

After character creation, players can view, edit and actively play with their characters, saving progress as it happens.

Characters can be leveled up, through a directed system that gives players all the options normally available in a game.

The database is searchable in an intuitive way to allow players to answer their questions about rules as quickly as possible and get back to playing the game.

### Philosophy:

From casting spells, to choosing new skills, the intention is to take the hassle of character management off the shoulders of the players and allow them to spend more time imagining and playing the game.

Along with this philosophy goes the notion that the player knows best. We believe in a hands off approach in many instances for a player to edit and 'correct' what has been automatically generated for them. After all, DnD is just as much about creativity and imagination as it is about rules.

### Future Features (in no particular order):

* Fuller creation and update features for character flair:
    * Character picture
    * Basic descriptive information (age, height, weight, etc.)
* Integrate a dice roller into spell casting and actions.
* Add a shop to buy/add additional gear.
* Incorporate experience points.
    * Currently the maker is playing in an experience points-less game where levels are gained every couple of sessions.
* Support for multi-class characters.
* A feature for preparing spells (for Cleric, Druid, Paladin, and Wizard classes)
* Feature to export characters to pdf (for printing) or xml for reloading into the system.
* Implement a customizable layout of the character sheet.
    * Move different information around the screen to suit the player.
    * Save layouts for individual characters and accounts.
* Color Themes
* Allow players to create content and add to database.
* Allow players to cast spells at specific levels.

### Known Bugs:

* Currently users can spoof their ability scores, giving themselves more than they should.
* Currently the 'buy' section of ability score assignment does not return points correctly.

### Developer's Note

At the current stage, this is not a publicly available product as the database incorporates the full 5th Edition Player's Handbook. Thus it is only for the personal use of the developer. In the future, a release is planned that scales back to incorporate only the SRD (officially released game information from Wizard's of the Coast for third party content). This is to ensure that copyrights are not infringed upon.

This project is built in Django.
