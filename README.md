# 5E Character Sheet Manager (CSM)

### Intent:

CSM is a fully integrated character sheet manager for players of 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons.

Players are able to create characters and use the integrated tools to manage their characters throughout their play of the game. From casting spells, to choosing new skills, the intention is to take the hassle of character management off the shoulders of the players and allow them to spend more time imagining and playing the game.

At the current stage, this will not be a publicly available product as the database incorporates the full 5th Edition Player's Handbook. In the future, a release is planned that scales back to incorporate only the SRD (officially released game information from Wizard's of the Coast for third party content).

### Future Features:

* Integrate a dice roller into spell casting and actions.
* Add a shop to buy/add additional gear.
* Incorporate experience points.
    * Currently the maker is playing in an experience points-less game where levels are gained every couple of sessions.
* Support for multi-class characters.
* A feature for preparing spells (for Cleric, Druid, Paladin, and Wizard classes)
* Support spellcasting for Warlocks.
* Implement a customizable layout of the character sheet.
    * Move different information around the screen to suit the player.
    * Save layouts for individual characters and accounts.
* Color Themes
* Allow players to create content and add to database.
